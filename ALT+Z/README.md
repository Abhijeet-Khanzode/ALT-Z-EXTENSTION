Extension Usage
1. In Chrome, go to chrome://extensions → Enable Developer mode → Load unpacked → select the `extension` folder.
2. Start the local server (see server/README.md).
3. On any webpage, select text and press Alt+Z. The extension will send the selected text to the local server which forwards it to the bot.
4. Alternatively, click the extension icon and paste/send text using the popup.
